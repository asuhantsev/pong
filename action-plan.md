# Action Plan

This guide lists the work required to make the Pong project fully playable in
both single and multiplayer modes.

1. **Project Setup**
   - Ensure Node 18+ is installed.
   - Run `npm install` in the root and `server/` directories.

2. **Core Gameplay**
   - Finalize physics in `usePhysics` for ball movement, paddle collision and
     scoring.
   - Wire `useGame` with `usePhysics` in `GameBoard` to control the game loop
     and countdowns.
   - Implement a basic AI opponent for single player.

3. **Multiplayer Functionality**
   - Expand the Node server to handle rooms and player connections.
   - Define socket events for joining, updating paddles and syncing the ball.
   - Connect these events in `useMultiplayer` and `GameSyncContext`.
   - Add reconnection logic and basic latency compensation.

4. **User Interface**
   - Refine menus (`MainMenu`, `MultiplayerMenu`, `OptionsMenu`).
   - Display network status and errors via `NetworkContext` and `ErrorContext`.
   - Show scores and the winner overlay using `ScoreBoard` and overlays.

5. **Testing Suite**
   - Extend Jest tests for contexts, hooks and React components.
   - Add unit tests for server socket handlers with supertest.
   - Keep tests isolated and fast.

6. **Deployment**
   - Prepare `render.yaml` for production hosting.
   - Add GitHub Actions workflow to run `npm test` on pull requests.

Follow this plan when implementing new features and reviewing contributions.
